Welcome to a detailed overview of Data Science in Physics!
===========================================================

This website covers the use of data science in physics from the most fundamental ideas dating back hudrends of years ago, all the way to how contemporary AI influences modern physics research. The content is structured as a series of executable notebooks which guide you through a specific way to use data science to study different problems in physics and primer sections explaining key prerequisite concepts.
